Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

### Introduction
- In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits.

### Code
- **ex3.m** - Octave script that will help step you through part 1
- **ex3 nn.m** - Octave script that will help step you through part 2

- **submitWeb.m** - Alternative submission script
- **submit.m** - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers
- **displayData.m** - Function to help visualize the dataset
- **fmincg.m** - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)
- **sigmoid.m** - Sigmoid function
- **lrCostFunction.m** - Logistic regression cost function
- **oneVsAll.m** - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier
- **predictOneVsAll.m** - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier
- **predict.m** - Neural network prediction function

### Data
- **ex3data1.mat** - Training set of hand-written digits
- **ex3weights.mat** - Initial weights for the neural network exercise
